# Batch Conversion
Batch conversion of files in Windows Command Line (cmd Win x64 or Powershell) using a `.bat` Script file. Here it's a batch conversion of various document type files to pdf format. But essentially the process is the same for any batch conversion with the `for` construct in cmd.

# Requirements 
For using this script for pdf batch conversion install the latest version of calibre from : https://calibre-ebook.com/download_windows which will give us the command line module `ebook-convert` that can be used for conversion.

# Usage 
Simple double-click on the `convert_to_pdf.bat` after placing it in the appropriate directory or invoke the script from the command line for converting `.mobi`,`.epub`,`.djvu`,`.chm`,`.lit`,`.azw3` files in the directory to `.pdf`.

Also `convert.bat` can be used for operations and conversion of other file types in a similar manner.
